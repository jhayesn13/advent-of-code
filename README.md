Advent of Code 2025

## Features


To create a new notebook for the current day's puzzle, run this command:
```bash
uv run make_nb
```

Otherwise, to create a template for any specific day, run a command like this:
```bash
uv run make_nb --year=<year> --day=<day>
```

To create all the notebooks for the current year, run:
```bash
uv run ./scripts/make-all-nbs.sh
```

For a previous (or future) year, try:
```bash
uv run ./scripts/make-all-nbs.sh --year=<year> --count=<number-of-days>
```

## /Requirements


Follow the instructions below to save your token:
https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-wim/issues/1

Then run
```bash
uv run ./scripts/install-ipykernel.sh.jinja
```


## Development Environment
### Install [uv]

To install [uv],
[follow the official instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
or, alternatively, install with [Homebrew]:

```shell
brew install uv
```

### Install Jupyter kernel
First, create a user-global Jupyter installation, e.g., with [uv]:
```shell
uv tool install jupyter-core \
  --with jupyterlab --with pyviz-comms --with pip
```

Then, install a kernel for this project:
```shell
uv run ./scripts/install-ipykernel.sh
```

Now you can work in this project and all of its dependencies by selecting the appropriate kernel. You can uninstall it with:

```shell
uv run ./scripts/uninstall-ipykernel.sh
```

#### Working with interactive dependencies


Extra packages &mdash; e.g. for data analysis and visualization &mdash; can be

installed by adding them to the `dev` list under

`[dependency-groups]` in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml) and then

syncing dependencies by running `uv sync`.  For example, you might add

some packages...



```bash

uv add --group=dev matplotlib numpy

```



and then sync dependencies by running `uv sync`.



## Upgrading tooling



Remember to upgrade these tools regularly:



```shell

brew upgrade uv

```



## How to test the project



To run the tests:



```shell

uv run ./scripts/test/test.sh

```



Unit tests are located in the _scripts/tests_ directory,

and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.



## How to lint and format the project



All linting and code formatting is performed via [pre-commit].

The series of customized

[Git hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)

that [pre-commit] may run is declared in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

In order to streamline the integration of this tool into your workflow,

this repo provides a `lint` dependency-group from which all

[pre-commit] commands should be run.



_**Tip**: See the `lint` section of the [dependency-groups] of the `pyproject.toml`

for the configuration of the dependencies &

`./scripts/lint/` for the definitions of the available commands._



The greatest benefit of this tool is that it can run the hooks

_automatically_ over the staged files each time you commit.

In order to do this, all you need to do is install the hooks once:



```shell

uv run ./scripts/lint/install.sh

```



To run the hooks manually over currently staged files:



```shell

uv run ./scripts/lint/run.sh

```



To run the hooks manually over all files in the repo:



```shell

uv run ./scripts/lint/run-all.sh

```



To update the hooks to the latest version

(_i.e., the latest tag on the default branch_)

automatically:



```shell

uv run ./scripts/lint/update.sh

```



If the hooks are acting up & a fresh reinstall seems advisable:



```shell

uv run ./scripts/lint/reinstall.sh

```



## How to upgrade dependency lockfiles



### Background



[lockfiles](https://blog.shalvah.me/posts/understanding-lockfiles).

Lockfiles are stored in the `uv.lock` file.

[uv] will resolve the dependencies based on the specification given for the dependency-groups in `pyproject.toml`,

install them, then write a lockfile. Once a lockfile exists for a given environment,

it is locked i.e., **it will not update** unless manually made to do so.



### How to "upgrade dependency lockfiles"



The simplest & most effective method to "upgrade" a lockfile

is to remove the lockfile then run `uv sync`.



To upgrade a specific package, run `uv add --upgrade-package <package>`
